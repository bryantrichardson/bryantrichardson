Bryant's Blog About Recent Cybersecurity Breaches

Objective
My objective with this blog is to keep an up to date list of the most recent Cybersecurity Breaches.  I will provide a brief overview of the breach itself followed by detailing how the breach occurred. I will conclude each attack by looking at possible ways the breach could have been mitigated or prevented entirely. I will be using this site https://tech.co/news/data-breaches-updated-list as my reference for the most recent breaches. Any additional sources I use for each breach will be listed at the bottom of the individual blog post.
