I am a recent graduate of UNC Charlotte Professional Studies Cybersecurity Bootcamp. I obtained my Security+ certificate from CompTIA in July 2024 and I am currently studying for my CCNA (expected 03/2025) as well. I am an eager learner trying to gain knowledge in the vast industries of information technology and cybersecurity through personal projects, books, and websites like TryHackMe.
